  <!-- Detailed textual summary below the diagram -->
  <div>
    <h2>Clause and modification summary</h2>

    <p>
      Main structure: The core independent clause is the compound-predicate clause whose subject is the pronoun "He" and whose predicates are "will teach" and "bring." The diagram places that subject and the compound predicate on the principal baseline, with a vertical divider separating the subject area (left) from the predicate area (right).
    </p>

    <p>
      Introductory item: "But" is an introducing/conjunctive element set before the subject. It establishes discourse contrast/transition but does not serve as subject or predicate and is placed above/left of the subject baseline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subject apposition: The subject pronoun "He" refers back to the noun phrase rendered on the left side: "the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name." That entire leftward noun phrase functions as the referent (antecedent) for "He." Within that noun phrase, "the Holy Spirit" is in apposition to "the Helper," so the appositive is diagrammed on a small subordinate baseline adjacent to the head noun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relative clause modifying the appositive: "whom the Father will send in My name" is a relative clause attached to the appositive "the Holy Spirit." In the diagram it appears on its own subordinate baseline beneath the appositive. Within that relative clause, "the Father" is the subject, "will send" is the verb, and "whom" functions as the relative object of "send." The prepositional phrase "in My name" modifies "will send" and is diagrammed beneath the relative-clause verb.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compound predicate details: The predicate portion contains two coordinated actions sharing the same subject "He":
      - First action: "will teach you all things." "Will teach" is the verb; "you" is the direct object (diagrammed on a short vertical connector) and "all things" is the noun phrase indicating the scope/extent of the teaching.
      - Coordinating conjunction "and" links the two predicate actions and sits on the baseline between them.
      - Second action: "bring to your remembrance all that I said to you." "Bring" is the verb; its complement is a prepositional phrase "to your remembrance" (diagrammed beneath the verb with "to" on a slanted connector and "your remembrance" on a subordinate horizontal object line).
    </p>

    <p>
      Object of "bring": The phrase "all that I said to you" functions as the direct object (or object-equivalent) of "bring." In the diagram, "all" begins a subordinate connection to a relative/subordinate clause introduced by "that." The relative/subordinate clause "that I said to you" has its own baseline: "I" is the subject, "said" is the verb, and the prepositional phrase "to you" is attached beneath "said" as the indirect object/recipient.
    </p>

    <p>
      Summary of modification relationships:
      - "But" modifies the sentence discourse (introductory).
      - "the Helper" is the head noun of the left noun phrase; "the Holy Spirit" is an appositive renaming that head.
      - The relative clause "whom the Father will send in My name" modifies "the Holy Spirit" (the appositive/head referent).
      - The pronoun "He" is co-referential with "the Helper / the Holy Spirit" and serves as the grammatical subject of the main clause.
      - "will teach" takes "you" and "all things" as its objects/complements.
      - "bring" takes the prepositional complement "to your remembrance" and the object phrase "all that I said to you," where "that I said to you" is a subordinate clause modifying "all."
